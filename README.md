# School-Project

This is a final project for my Computer Science class.
The program will simulate a banking database system, allowing the creation of bank accounts for either Normal Customers or Premium Customers.
Each bank account will have the ability to deposit and withdraw funds and interest rates can be freely applied and changes for Premium Customers.
Banking data such as banking account numbers, name under the account, transaction history (with date and times), and interest rates can be freely viewed as well.
The ability to terminate banking accounts via their banking account numbers is also included.
Banking account details are saved to a txt file that the program creates and references to when calling upon previously established banking account details.

The purpose of this program is to represent the understanding of core C++ concepts and how they can all be applied together to aid in the operation of a real world system.
